Amazon-Scraper
==============

>This repository contains classes for scraping various elements of Amazon book/product pages.
I will be updating/improving these from time to time. I will eventually encapsulate all processeses within 
a single object
###books.py

>books.py contains a class which is able to scrape the books that buyers of the book in question have also bought

###infoscrape.py

>infoscrape.py contains a class capable of getting the title, authorname and product details of a book

###reviewscrape.py
>reviewscrape.py contains functions capable of getting a breakdown of reviews for a given product.
This one still needs a lot of work
